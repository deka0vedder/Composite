MATLAB code which returns stress and strains in each lamina of the composite material, First ply failure load and the last ply failure load for a given composite of known laminate stacking sequence, geometrical and hygro-thermo-mechanical properties of each lamina and the applied loads.

Input: Laminate Stacking Sequence (in terms of angle)
       Geometrical and Hygro-thermo-mechanical properties of each Lamina
       Applied Loads (Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My, Mxy)

Output: Stresses and strains in each lamina
        First ply failure load
        Last ply failure load,
